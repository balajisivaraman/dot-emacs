;; Add `ibuffer-vc' and `persistent-scratch' packages.

;;; Code:

(use-package ibuffer-vc
  :config
  (evil-set-initial-state 'ibuffer-mode 'normal)
  (add-hook
   'ibuffer-hook
   (lambda ()
     (ibuffer-vc-set-filter-groups-by-vc-root)
     (unless (eq ibuffer-sorting-mode 'alphabetic)
       (ibuffer-do-sort-by-alphabetic)))))
(bind-key "C-x C-b" 'ibuffer)

(use-package persistent-scratch
  :config (persistent-scratch-setup-default))

(provide 'init-buffers)
